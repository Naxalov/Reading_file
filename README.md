Assignment: Reading and Processing Data from a File

**Introduction:**

This assignment focuses on fundamental file handling and data manipulation in Python. You will work with a Python function designed to read a file containing numbers and convert them into a list of integers. The goal is to understand how to open, read, and process file contents for further analysis or calculations.

**Tasks:**

1.  **Complete the Function:** The provided function `read_file(filename)` is incomplete. Your primary task is to fill in the missing code within this function. Specifically:
    *   Open the file in the correct mode for reading ('r').
    *   Read the file's content, ensuring it's converted from strings to integers.
    *   Close the file properly to release resources.
    *   Return the resulting list of integers.

2.  **Implement `print_list(data)`:** Create a separate function `print_list(data)` that takes a list of numbers (integers) as input and prints each element on a new line, along with its index (position) in the list. For example:

    ```
    Index 0: 5
    Index 1: 12
    Index 2: 8
    ```

3.  **Test and Validate:** Thoroughly test your code by creating a sample text file containing numbers. Call the `read_file` function with the file's name and then pass the returned list to `print_list` to verify if it works correctly.

**Background:**

*   **File Handling:**  Familiarize yourself with Python's `open()` function for opening files, its different modes (e.g., 'r' for reading), and methods like `read()` or `readlines()` for extracting content. Understand the importance of closing files using `close()`.
*   **Data Conversion:** Learn how to convert data from one type to another, specifically from strings (text) to integers (whole numbers). Explore Python's built-in functions like `int()` or list comprehensions for this purpose.

**Code Structure and Style Guidelines:**

*   Follow good Python naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for variables and functions).
*   Include clear and concise comments within your code to explain its logic.
*   Use meaningful variable names that reflect their purpose.
*   Maintain consistent indentation for readability.

**Expected Output:**

When your completed code is run, it should:

1.  Successfully read the numbers from the input file.
2.  Convert the numbers into a list of integers.
3.  Print each integer along with its index, formatted as shown in the example above.
